~~~~~~~~~ Java Gearman Service 0.0.1 ~~~~~~~~~

Gearman provides a generic application framework to farm out work to other machines
or processes that are better suited to do the work. It allows you to do work in
parallel, to load balance processing, and to call functions between languages. It can
be used in a variety of applications, from high-availability web sites to the
transport of database replication events. In other words, it is the nervous system
for how distributed processing communicates.

The Java Gearman Service provides a complete implementation of the gearman framework
in java, including the client, worker, and server.
